        <p>How education is changing in the future</p>

    </div>
    <div class=row style="margin: 15px;">
        <div class="col">
            <p>Education is changing much more now than it has in the past. Education was once, go to a class, listen to
                a
                lecture, take a test. This format was very common and while still being used education is moving away
                from
                this. Classes that require more student participation, exploration, and inquiry-based learning are all
                becoming more common. These new ways of teaching could be more effective to students who are
                uninterested in
                school. Instead of a student going to school to listen to lectures for hours, they are given projects to
                work on, and asked to explore their ideas, and learn more about the questions that they are interested
                in.
                The education system is also moving away from standardized testing, as it does not equally represent all
                studentsâ€™ abilities. Some students could be very intelligent, but bad at taking tests, and these people
                will
                be underrepresented. This move away from standardized tests can be seen by the fact that many
                universities
                have dropped the SAT and ACT requirements from their admissions.
            </p>
            <p>Education has also made a large increase online since the pandemic. Many classes are taught only online
                so people can join the class from anywhere. This can help alleviate certain issues that higher education
                sometimes faces. For example, if two classes that a student wanted to take were scheduled at the same
                time, if these classes were offered asynchronously online, this student now has more opportunities to
                take the classes that interest them, rather than being forced to choose. The increased online aspect of
                education also makes collaboration easier, as people can collaborate without even being in the same
                country as one another. Online schooling can increase the versatility within the education system.</p>
