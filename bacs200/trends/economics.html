            <p>The economy is always changing and growing, however the recent world events of the pandemic combined with
                the technology that is available to everyone has changed how the business function successfully. As
                technology continues to get better, so will peoplesâ€™ expectations of them. Many businesses could be at
                risk from another business that integrates the same services with technology. For example, Uber and Lyft
                changed the taxi industry, from hailing a cab to pressing a button on a phone. Uber and Lyft
                revolutionized the taxi service, when is the last time that you heard someone say they were getting a
                cab not an uber? These businesses are successful, Uber is currently worth $87.54B, and the economy is
                not slowing down for these more technologically focused companies.

            <p>This technological push of business has been accelerated by the pandemic and social distancing. While
                many stores have more restrictions and guidelines, online shopping has increased in popularity. For many
                people that wanted to stay home, or were quarantined and still wanted to purchase things, amazon became
                the go to source for all their shopping needs. Amazon who has been successful in dominating the online
                shopping area for some time now, has gotten even bigger during the pandemic, as for many people their
                only option was to order things online. When it comes to ordering things, online Amazon is the clear
                choice, with amazon prime, people get free two-day shipping, if not shorter. If businesses want to be
                able to compete with Amazon, they need to have an efficient place to order their products and efficient
                shipping for their products.</p>
