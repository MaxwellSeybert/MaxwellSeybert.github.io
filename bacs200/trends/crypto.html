            <p>Cryptocurrency is a relatively new idea, and only in the past few years has it soared in popularity. With
                currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum becoming very popular, this leaves many people wondering where is
                this going? Where crypto currency is going depends on how everyone treats crypto in the future.

            </p>
            <p>If crypto continues to be treated the way it is today, with many people seeing it as a new kind of stock
                market without regulations, and much more volatility, then that is likely how it will stay. Currently,
                many people see crypto as new way to strike it rich, buy the dips and sell the highs, while that is
                possible in the current crypto market that was not the goal. This is because crypto has made it
                mainstream, and gained huge popularity, everybody knows what bitcoin is. Everyone also knows that if
                they bought bitcoin 7 years ago, they would be rich today. However, this trading game that people play
                with crypto is different from the intended goal of creating a decentralized currency.
            </p>
            <p>Cryptoâ€™s intention is to create a decentralized currency, in other words, a currency that is not tied to
                a government. This is done on the blockchain, a large ledger of transactions, that everyone is keeping
                track of together. With the blockchain currency no longer needs to be traded through a bank, and no
                longer needs to be tied to the government. As crypto continues to grow this goal can be achieved by more
                businesses accepting crypto payments. The current issue with crypto payments is that it is such a
                volatile asset that many businesses would not accept it out of fear that it will lose value and they
                will lose money. Crypto will continue to only be a volatile investment unless businesses start accepting
                them so they can be treated the same as other currencies. </p>
