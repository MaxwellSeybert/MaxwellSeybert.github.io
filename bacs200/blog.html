                                While social media can be great in allowing people to stay in touch with others or even
                                create new connections, it does have drawbacks. For example, while not everyone on the
                                internet is hateful, there exist many people that enjoy hurting others and bringing them
                                dowm. These people can be very active on the internet and cause many people to be hurt.

                                can also make people feel ostracized, since there are people with wildly huge follower
                                counts in the millions, a person who
                                does not have a large online presence may feel like they are a less important as a

                                Social media is great for businesses and consumers alike as both now have a better means
                                of communication with eachother
                                rather than either calling a call center to get help or going to a retail store in hopes
                                for assistance. Now people can just tweet at a brands' support team and get help
                                relativley quickly. Things like YouTube have changed the economy as many people want to
                                and viable could be a "Youtuber" in which they make videos about
                                something they are passionate about. However, social media has also increased the
                                chances that someone falls victim to a scam. Since anyone can make a social media
                                account and pretend to be a business, scams have increased.

                    <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
                    collapse
                    plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the
                    overall
                    appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with
                    custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can
                    go
                    within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
