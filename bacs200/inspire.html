<h1>My Inspiration</h1>
<p> One person I would say that has inspired me is Steve Jobs. 
    Steve Jobs inspires me because of how many things he was able to accomplish in life. 
    He started apple and it turned into a super successful company that revolutionized the phone. 
    He also helped start pixar, which created many of the movies that I watched as a child.
    Steve Jobs was able to accomplish a lot in his life, from making computers, phones and animating movies. </p>
